# Application Name: AutoInfo

Team mates: Ahmed Alotaibi, Nurlybek, Ruslan

1- Ideas of the application:


A- Awareness of automotive craftsmanship. 
Simplicity of organizing & accessing details of 
vehicles based on make and model of car.
B- Users will be able to determine characteristics and specifications
of vehicles by choosing a make and model. 
C- Users are also able to create their account and
interact with each other using the chat functionality.
D- Users are also able to find the car make locations 
based on their choice of the car make. 
E- Users are guiding by Tutorial for more details 
of the use of the application. 


2- Software Engineering Practices


The Agile practices that our team has been implemented are listed below, most of the 
principles we follow are taken from iterative agile methodologies called “Lean”, “Scrum” and “XP”
1)Working as a self-organizing team and encouraging role interchangeability
The roles in our team were assigned by the group members and tasks of each members may be 
exchanged between members if the task is not clear to the particular member or if team member is willing to trade the task.
The results of implementing certain function or design feature would be written in Jira and could also
 be found in the github commits and comments

a)Continuous Integration

This practice was used by the group when we face difficulties to make the certain functionality work, 
therefore we were continuously integrating the alternative methods of implementing this functionality 
whenever break presented itself until functionality is up and running.

b)Rules of simplicity 

In the iteration of the project our team wasl trying to populate the app with data from the API, 
however the simplicity in the source code is our first pryority, 
therefore we set rules that needs to be followed: 
? the code is verified by automated tests, and all such tests pass 
? the code contains no duplication 
? the code expresses separately each distinct idea or responsibility

Quality assurance

a) Utilize Already-made Test Frameworks:
Our team is implementing tools for the testing that were 
specifically developed for the android platform. 
The system we were using is called “Fabric”, Fabric lets developers run tests with modular 
kits that can be mixed and matched to build the glitch free application.

Revision control system: 

1)  Only push changes to the global master branch
2)  Only push if the feature you added is working
3)  Whenever you push, you should pull first to avoid merge conflicts 
4)  Whenever new activity is created you should put it in the folder designed for this type of the activity
5)  Every activity layout XML file should be stored in the app/res/layout in the revision control system
